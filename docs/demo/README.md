# Percupuff Demo

This folder holds a demo version of Percupuff that runs as a web page.

To access it, start a web server in this folder (`python3 -m http.server`), and then browse to the address it chooses.

## Updating the Demo

Updating the demo doesn't work very nicely currently.

You have to:

- Export the patch (`percupuff.cmajorpatch`) as `HTML/Javascript/WebAssembly` (for example in VSCode).
  - As always, make sure you have an up to date built of the view before exporting.
  - If in doubt, run `npm run build` under `view`.
- Put the export in a temporary folder somewhere.
- Copy over:
  - The file `cmaj_Percupuff.js` and overwrite `docs/demo/cmaj_Percupuff.js`.
  - The `view` folder that was created by `export as HTML/Javascript/WebAssembly` and overwrite `docs/demo/view`.
  - This should only have a `dist` folder in it.
- Do not overwrite any of the other files, discard anything else that was generated by the export.
